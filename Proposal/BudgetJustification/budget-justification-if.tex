\subsection{\Large Intensity Frontier Program Budget Justification}
{\bf Preamble:} This section provides the budget justifications for the intensity frontier supplemental proposal.  Detailed description for each of the items is given in year one.  A canonical cost of living adjustment rate of 3\% is applied to all salaries in the subsequent years. Year two contains fewer details as in year one, but instead reflect the base rate and where noted any significant changes in effort.   

The tasks carried out off-campus incur substantially different indirect rates (51.5\% on-campus versus 26\% off-campus), therefore this request which is entirely off-campus incurs a significantly reduced indirect rate.   

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Cumulative - 17 Month}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item{{\bf Senior Personnel}: No senior personnel support is requested.}

\item {{\bf Postdoctoral Researcher}: A request for one postdoctoral fellow is made using the base salary of \$50,000 per annum for the first year and a canonical 3\% cost of living adjustment is applied in subsequent year.  The total requested amount for this item is \$125,969. The fringe benefit rate is 30\% of the request.  Since it is anticipated to have the postdoctoral fellow 100\% off campus and located full time at Fermilab, the indirect rate for this is 26\% of the cost.  This researcher will be contributing to the SBND and ICARUS experiments at Fermilab during their time with UTA.} 

\item{{\bf Graduate Students}: No support for graduate students is requests}

\item {{\bf Undergraduate Students}: No support for undergraduate students is requested}

\item{{\bf Travel and Cost of Living Adjustment}: A request for \$1,500 total for travel is requested.  This portion of the supplemental is meant to be used for COLA support for postdoctoral fellow. The amount is requested to be placed in our group’s LSA at Fermilab to minimize the indirect cost at UTA.}

\item {{\bf STEM Tuition}: No STEM tuition support is requested}

\item {{\bf M\&S}:No M\&S is requested}

\item {{\bf Total Fringe Benefit}: The total cost for the fringe benefit for 17 month period is \$22,725.}

\item {{\bf Total Indirect}: The total indirect cost computed using the off-campus (26\%) rate is \$25,994.}

\item {{\bf Grand Total for the entire proposal}: The total request for the seventeen month period is \$125,969.}

\end{itemize}

The amount is requested to be placed in our group’s LSA at Fermilab to minimize the indirect cost at UTA.}

\item {{\bf STEM Tuition}: No STEM tuition support is requested}

\item {{\bf M\&S}:No M\&S is requested}

\item {{\bf Grand Total for Year 1}: The grand total request for year one is \$83,160.}

\end{itemize}

\item{Year 2: 11/01/19 - 03/31/19}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item{{\bf Senior Personnel}: No senior personnel support is requested.}

\item {{\bf Postdoctoral Researcher}: A request for one postdoctoral fellow is made using the base salary of \$51,500 per annum, requested for the 6 month period. totalling \$25,750  The fringe benefit rate is 30\% of the request. Since it is anticipated to have the postdoctoral fellow 100\% off campus and located full time at Fermilab, the indirect rate for this is 26\% of the cost.}

\item{{\bf Travel and Cost of Living Adjustment}: A request for \$500 total for travel is requested during the second year.  This portion of the supplemental is meant to be used for COLA support for postdoctoral fellow. The amount is requested to be placed in our group’s LSA at Fermilab to minimize the indirect cost at UTA.}

\item {{\bf STEM Tuition}: No STEM tuition support is requested}

\item {{\bf M\&S}:No M\&S is requested}

\item {{\bf Total Fringe Benefit}: The total cost for the fringe benefit is \$7,725.}

\item {{\bf Total Indirect}: The total indirect cost computed using the off-campus rate (26\%) described above is \$8,834.}

\item {{\bf Grand Total for Year 1}: The grand total request for year two is \$42,809.}
